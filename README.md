# Haenndel's SQL Portfolio
<p align="justify">
ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my SQL Portfolio!

Within this repository, you will find a collection of SQL examples that I have crafted during my hours of study. Aspiring to excel in the world of data manipulation and database management, I've curated these examples to showcase my proficiency and understanding of SQL concepts. This portfolio reflects my journey in mastering SQL.


Feel welcome to check out the different SQL examples and codes I've carefully gathered here. Each one reflects a different puzzle I've faced and conquered. As you explore this collection, I hope you'll get a glimpse of my journey in SQL, from the early stages to where I am now. Feel free to ask any questions â€“ I'm here to help and share what I've learned along the way!

Thank you for joining me on this SQL journey!

Best regards,

Haenndel Santos
